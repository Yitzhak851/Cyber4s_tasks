            <h2>Apple</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>This article is about the fruit. For the technology company, see Apple Inc. For other uses, see Apple
                (disambiguation).
                "Apple tree" redirects here. For other uses, see Apple tree (disambiguation).
            </p>
            <p>
                An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated
                worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia,
                where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of
                years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious
                and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian
                tradition.

                Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit
                frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting
                onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after
                planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree,
                allowing for easier harvesting.

                There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and
                uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of
                fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic
                means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective
                breeding in apple production.

                Worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half of
                the total.[3]
